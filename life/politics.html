<p>Politics isn't something you can limit in boundaries. Everything, everywhere, revolves around cheating people, manipulating them and seeking opportunities wherever you can look. Even when we are facing a global pandemic, some of us are busy trading things for life of others. India, the country where I live, is the best example. The topmost leader is a liar with resources to take down anyone anywhere in the country who goes against him. The businesses there are like lice.

<p>I have no clue why, but looks the creator of us has stopped supplying responsibility and generosity with power. I love this world, but I hate politics since the definition have been altered completely.</p>
