<h2>Partially Broken Animations</h2>
<p>Recently, I was trying to use combined animations, and they didn't work. After some trial and error, I found that keyframes were missing. I created an issue on their GitHub repo. Meanwhile, I was trying to figure out what's wrong with it.</p>
<p>It turned out their internal plugin for animations, which was working in v1, was broken in v2. The culprit was this line.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">let</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> name<span class="token operator">:</span> animationName <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">parseAnimationValue</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>value<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token comment">// So this means parseAnimationValue is always an object</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Raw animations were being parsed, and their value was being extracted in an <code class="language-js"><span class="token known-class-name class-name">Object</span></code> for processing. So, <code class="language-js">parseAnimationValue</code> should return an <code class="language-js"><span class="token known-class-name class-name">Object</span></code> containing <code class="language-js">name</code>, but the declaration of this function said otherwise.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword module">export</span> <span class="token keyword module">default</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">parseAnimationValue</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">input</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// ... some parsing work</span>
  <span class="token keyword control-flow">return</span> animations<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">length</span> <span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token number">1</span> <span class="token operator">?</span> result <span class="token operator">:</span> result<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>According to the declaration, for combined animation, it returns an <code class="language-js"><span class="token known-class-name class-name">Array</span></code> of animation <code class="language-js"><span class="token known-class-name class-name">Object</span></code>. So, I tried fixing it, which took a few minutes, and created a pull request with tests.</p>
<p>At this point, I was hoping that in the worst case, I'll get some kind of feedback on how impractical my solution was. After a week, my pull request was still in black hole. So, I simply closed it thinking maybe they don't care, and since my animations were defined in CSS by now. I moved on with life.</p>
<h2>Broken syntax highlighting</h2>
<p>So, to reduce class pollution in HTML, I decided to use tailwind in CSS directly. Since, I was planning to redesign my website, I decided to apply it there. Tailwind bundles <code class="language-text">postcss-nested</code> which is <code class="language-text">sass</code> like syntax for <code class="language-text">postcss</code>. Highlighting for this was broken in both VSCode and VIM. Before tailwind, I was using <code class="language-text">postcss-preset-env</code> which included stage 1 implementation of css-nesting spec called <code class="language-text">postcss-nesting</code>. Tailwind supports that. So, I quickly installed it and did necessary changes.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">module<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">exports</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  plugins<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>
    <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'postcss-import'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'tailwindcss/nesting'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'postcss-nesting'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'tailwindcss'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    <span class="token function">require</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'autoprefixer'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The Next build system started to complain that I can only use strings as plugin. Passing this plugin as options didn't work either. The syntax highlight was working great, but my build itself was broken.</p>
<h2>Down the rabbit hole</h2>
<p>I decided to fork tailwind and use my fork directly from GitHub. I did and applied my changes as well. Next was <code class="language-text">postcss-nesting</code> so, I made that one default in tailwind. I wanted my changes to be as minimal and as isolated as possible so that merging from upstream will be easy. I found out, no matter what nesting plugin I use, for styles defined in config, tailwind uses <code class="language-text">postcss-nested</code>. After adjusting tests and fixing other bugs, there were still two reasons causing my version to break. <code class="language-text">postcss-nesting</code> didn't support bubble of custom at rules, and the CSS resulted from it has semicolons removed. Luckily, that plugin was very simple, so I added bubbling support for tailwind at rules, fixed semicolons and ported tests to jest.</p>
<p>Next was the battle of <code class="language-text">commonjs</code> vs <code class="language-text">esm</code> and the build. It took a while to add fallback in imports and fixing broken stuff due to this. My fork was still unusable since npm published version had transpiled commonjs modules. I didn't want to use npm, so I decided to publish build files in an orphan branch. With some git tricks around worktree, I was able to put together a branch with transpiled modules. A deployment script later, I was finally able to use my fork while still being able to rebase with upstream.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, while I'm still using Tailwind, I no longer do it the tailwind way, but everything works smoothly now. Instead of doing <code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">yarn</span> <span class="token function">add</span> tailwindcss</code> I can do <code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">yarn</span> <span class="token function">add</span> mohitsinghs/tailwindcss<span class="token comment">#x</span></code> and on the top of that I can finally fix things without my pull request in black hole. Investing a day or two to save weeks of waiting on fixes is a better way to learn things we use.</p>
<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>So, one of the bugs got fixed in tailwindcss and I deleted my fork but learned a lot during process of mindlessly modifying tailwindcss sources. So, back to tailwind but still not satisfied with a lot of things.</p>

A deployment script later, I was finally able to use my fork while still being able to rebase with upstream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, while I'm still using Tailwind, I no longer do it the tailwind way, but everything works smoothly now. Instead of doing \u003ccode class=\"language-bash\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token function\"\u003eyarn\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"token function\"\u003eadd\u003c/span\u003e tailwindcss\u003c/code\u003e I can do \u003ccode class=\"language-bash\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"token function\"\u003eyarn\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"token function\"\u003eadd\u003c/span\u003e mohitsinghs/tailwindcss\u003cspan class=\"token comment\"\u003e#x\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e and on the top of that I can finally fix things without my pull request in black hole. Investing a day or two to save weeks of waiting on fixes is a better way to learn things we use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eUpdates\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, one of the bugs got fixed in tailwindcss and I deleted my fork but learned a lot during process of mindlessly modifying tailwindcss sources. So, back to tailwind but still not satisfied with a lot of things.\u003c/p\u003e\n"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[...posts]","query":{"posts":["code","no-tailwind"]},"buildId":"vLj-h1l1iYxo80BnxHitK","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
