<h2>1. Amara's Law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>2. Brook's Law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>3. Conway's Law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>4. Cunningham's Law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>5. Gall's Law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>6. Goodhart's Law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>7. Hofstadter's law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>8. Kerckhoffs's principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A cryptographic system should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>9. Knuth's optimization principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Premature optimization is the root of all evil.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>10. Linus's law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>11. Moore's Law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>12. Murphy's law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>13. Ninety-ninety rule</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>14. Norvig's Law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Any technology that surpasses 50% penetration will never double again.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>15. Pareto Principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>For many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>16. Parkinson's Law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>17. Postel's Law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>18. Peter principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>19. Price’s law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>50% of the work is done by the square root of the total number of people who participate in the work.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>20. (5) Laws of Software Estimates</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Software estimates are waste, non-transferable, wrong, temporary and necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>21. Sturgeon's Law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Ninety percent of everything is crap.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>22. Wirth's Law</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware is becoming faster.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These laws are collected from various sources and I learned a thing or two in the process. There are still some laws and principles I might have missed since I tried to avoid more technical one. While these are not absolute by any means, being aware of these helps us save ourselves from chaos sometimes.</p>
